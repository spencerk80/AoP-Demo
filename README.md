# AoP-Demo
A simple employee info management system (saves data only in ram) that was designed to allow me to play with Aspect oriented programming.

## AoP
Aspect oriented Programming allows one to separate business and other logic, such a logging. I have demonstrated this in this project. No where in the prompts can you find logging code, yet all the prompts method trances are logged thanks to AoP.
